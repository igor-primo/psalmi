#psalmi-feria

I do not think the 1961 Liber Usualis is very "useful" when it comes to the minor hours,
so I made a quick script to make something more useful. Contains only the Psalms from
the minor hours, but all tones, despite their never being really covered.

Psalms take from: https://bbloomf.github.io/jgabc/psalmtone.html
